## Lazy K program

`main.scm` implements an answer to the codegolf.SE challenge "[Confound my attempts to solve the halting problem](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/248185)." It depends on a slightly modified version of [Lazier](https://github.com/msullivan/LazyK/blob/master/lazier.scm), which is released under the GPL.

`Find3.hs` is a brute forcer for SKI terms with desired properties. It can be compiled using the provided Makefile.
