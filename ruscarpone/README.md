# The Mascarpone programming language

**Become lost in a Rusty maze of meta-circular interpreters, all alike...**

This is a Rust implementation of Chris Pressey's Mascarpone programming language.
More information about the language, as well as a reference interpreter written in Haskell,
can be found [here](https://github.com/catseye/Mascarpone/).

This implementation supports all the behavior mentioned in the spec and runs all of the
example programs correctly.
