This repository contains most of the [esolang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language)-related projects I've worked on over the years. I've manually rewritten the git history so each directory contains what in the past might have been its own repository. Some of these are my own languages; some are implementations of others' languages; some are programs written in esolangs. Some projects are complete and documented with examples; others don't even compile.

Regardless, I hope you find them interesting.
